Linear Regression Project
This repository contains a project focused on the analysis and application of linear regression to predict variables based on linear relationships. Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique that aims to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables through a straight line.

## What is Linear Regression?
Linear regression is a statistical method that seeks to understand the relationship between a dependent variable (the one we want to predict) and one or more independent variables (those we use for prediction). In simple terms, it tries to find the best straight line that fits the data.

## Project Description
This project utilizes linear regression to predict the hiring or non-hiring of a banking product through the collection and analysis of data (extracted via URL).
